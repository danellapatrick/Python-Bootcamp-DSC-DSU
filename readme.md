# DSC-DSU | Python Bootcamp 2020 | Week 1

Paste questions and brief writeup 
In the first question i simply  used increment operator and initatlized space = '' 

in the second question i used function and made function for each key in the dictionary and the values were the input taken. 
I used datat frames to print my data in tabular form 

in the third question i simply used .sleep() and gave 1 second of time to print each sentence and i have done the question in another way where i used split to break string in list and then made another list by sepration them with comma  and again converted the string  in list and used .time1 function
